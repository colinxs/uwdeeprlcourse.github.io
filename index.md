## Course Information

Deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) is an emerging research field that has made tremendous advances in the last few years. Most notable among them are: AlphaGo beating the world champion in the ancient game of Go, Deep Q-Networks that achieved human level performance on a wide range of computer games, and many many advances in robotics.

RL deals with the problem of how to make broadly competent decisions in a wide range of dynamic and uncertain environments. Since the problem of decision making under uncertainty is prevalent in almost every field, the set of algorithmic and modeling tools provided by RL are broadly applicable. This course aims to provide an overview of the recent developments in RL combined with advances in deep learning. We plan to take a broad perspective on RL as a problem setting and cover a wide range of methods: model-free RL, model-based RL, imitation learning, search and trajectory optimization. The expected course outcomes are:
- Understand a modern take on RL (+ deep learning).
- Be able to spot applications of RL in a wide variety of settings.
- Develop sufficient proficiency to be able to perform research in this field.

## Prerequisites

The course assumes a strong footing in the following, comparable to taking a graduate or advanced undergraduate level course:
- Linear algebra (refresher [notes](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/15-884/linalg-review.pdf) by Zico Kolter and Chuong Do)
- Machine learning (see [CSE446](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/18wi/) or [CSE546](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse546/17au/))
- Proficiency in python (quick [tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/)). In addition, homeworks and project report should be typeset in LaTeX (quick [tutorial](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes))

## Homeworks and Grading

We will have 2 (or 3) homeworks and a course project. The homeworks are intended primarily to get you started with resources for studying RL questions and algorithms, and hence are expected to be: (a) fairly light; (b) somewhat open-ended. The course project must be construed as the principal outcome of this course.
- Project: 60%
- Homeworks: 30%
- Discussions and participation: 10%
